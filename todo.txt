WiRoc
=====
Add option to reconfigure remote wiroc
Change from bleno to use python/bluez, with option to connect to BT-serial

App
===



Done
----

X Test max sending frequency without ack:  >~1.5 per second
X Test max sending frequency with ack > ~1.2 per second
X Add one-way option for connecting to samlingsboxar, srr dongles [WiRoc Python Done, app remaining]
X add RSSI to test punches
X Test RX Gain option (didn't see any difference in first test, but not sure if test was ok, RSSI is same. Dorji says enable can have small advantage)
x Add HW version file
x Add Settings file (for pesisting devicename, potentially other settings)
x The status light shouldn't blink when BLE fails, fail the service also?
x Patch the BLE fails, add delay to the redo when fails
x Make app work with old wiroc version
x Change to use 'single' BLE service to speed up connection
x Show repeater/sender/receiver somewhere
x RSSI value not saved in database
x SITEST doesn't set SI message kolumn values in messagebox
x when module returns something but it is not busy or ok it can be beginning of other message.
x When module returns 'busy' we should wait longer before retrying
x Add success should only be done when ack received for a matching message
x Add option to change ECC rate

possible HW enhancments
-----------------------
RS232 Serialport (use TTL->RS232 converter embedded in R232Connector)
  -- Need to move GPIOA0-GPIO3 pins to GPIOC0-3 (GPIOA0 = TX, GPIOA1 = RX)
RTC (realtime clock)
Make the PCB the size and shape of the box
Move the Rx and Tx LEDs together, use different colors
Reroute SDA, SCK to the display
Test resistor in series with button to see if we can get it not triggering under water
    -- Gummiknappen ~50kohm
    -- vitknapp ~30+kohm
    -- svartknapp ~35kohm
-> 51 kOhm fungerar (51+35kohm - 86 fungerar inte)
-> 31 kOhm fungerar (31+35kohm - 66 fungerar inte)
-> 26 kOhm fungerar (26+35kohm - 61 fungerar inte)
===> Seem to only be a problem when the antennaconnector is under water too, so shouldnt be an issue in real life. Even though, change the resistor from 1K to 24Kohm



IDs
----
Options for IDs
Logical MessageID: cardno, time (and stationo) [4 bytes + 4 bytes] (all included in serialmessage)
other option?: MemoryAddress 2 bytes, WiRoc-serialno 2 bytes (=>could be same memoryaddress from different SI masters)
other option?: WiRoc-serialno + messageid in database 2+2 bytes (=> adds 3 bytes to message)


Ack could include request to resend missed messages. Good idea? Or just a resend adapter fetching from failed messages?
