WiRoc
=====
- SRR dongle often doesn't initialize correctly, doesn't respond in time to query, seem to get reply later

- Should we change to not retry, or limit retries to configure SI-USB as two-way when it fails?
- Option to set SRR as output
- Send configurations to webbserver (srr setting already sent)
- Send local ip address to webbserver ( add to devices )
- Add cardno etc to database for SRRMessages


SRR code
========
- Power optimization
- measure resend intervals, is it same or does it increase or is it random.
- "Software flow control" setting for dongle (expert mode in SI Config), what does it do
- SRR receiver receives SRR ack messages (from other srr dongle?) should probably not put them in punch queue (SRR reciever firmware)


-- Maybe (probably pretty complex, unsure how useful)
Add option to reconfigure remote wiroc

App
===

- Configure input / output for SRR



Done
----
x Getting releases from wiroc.se
x Enable/disable red/blue channel
x - Resubmit adapter that fetches failed messages from archive. Both Lora and Sirap (others?)
x set unique btaddress if required / save it in file system and in axp209 to keep it persistent
x add rtc_pcf8563 line to /etc/modules
x Turn off the old red status LED and use the yellow led on the nanopineo air board instead
x Send status with no of lora messages that hasn't been acked. In relay path no byte we can use 6 bits. Battery percent has 1 bit left
x Status send for remote wiroc units doesnt seem to work, doesn't turn green
x Install should build reed solomon library with cython
X Test max sending frequency without ack:  >~1.5 per second
X Test max sending frequency with ack > ~1.2 per second
X Add one-way option for connecting to samlingsboxar, srr dongles [WiRoc Python Done, app remaining]
X add RSSI to test punches
X Test RX Gain option (didn't see any difference in first test, but not sure if test was ok, RSSI is same. Dorji says enable can have small advantage)
x Add HW version file
x Add Settings file (for pesisting devicename, potentially other settings)
x The status light shouldn't blink when BLE fails, fail the service also?
x Patch the BLE fails, add delay to the redo when fails
x Make app work with old wiroc version
x Change to use 'single' BLE service to speed up connection
x Show repeater/sender/receiver somewhere
x RSSI value not saved in database
x SITEST doesn't set SI message kolumn values in messagebox
x when module returns something but it is not busy or ok it can be beginning of other message.
x When module returns 'busy' we should wait longer before retrying
x Add success should only be done when ack received for a matching message
x Add option to change ECC rate
x Change from bleno to use python/bluez, with option to connect to BT-serial
x Make it possible to select Lora mode
x Set Receive or Send for RS232, app + api + recievesi class + sendcomputer?
x Investigate if we need to release rfcomm if it is in closed state. Noticed when testing, but not sure how to replicate.
x -- https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/352494/alternative-to-the-now-deprecated-rfcomm-binary-in-bluez
x -- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62652901/how-do-i-broadcast-bluetooth-inquiry-with-python-sockets-af-bluetooth-socket
x Changed to use sockets from Python instead of serial ports and RFCOMM to connect to Bluetooth serial devices
x Change how RS232 input works to avoid it from trying to init every 10s. Maybe always open read only. And when first message arrive reconfigure/reinit with two-way if that is selected.
x Make subclasses for receivesiadapter with each type (USB, RS232, Bluetooth)
x Set autosend automatically if not set when initializing
x In lora SendData function, if OK is not returned then read all data and add to LoraRadioDataHandler, look for OK at the end, accept it and remove it. Set a variable to allow GetRadioData to fetch the message (see row 6266 for example: Documents/WiRoc/Competitions/Fänestad20220409/LogArchive_D4\:12\:43\:24\:70\:F5_2022-04-09-14\:39\:49/home/chip/WiRoc-Python-2/WiRoc.log.2)
x pass msgSubBatch to the callbacks, set same datetime as sent date for all messages in a batch
x Save last messageid sent, when ack arrive and message is corrupted and cant be recovered then compare and still allow it if the message id is correct
x Remove only message fetched from datareceived, clear all only when no message was successfully fetched
x Send first test punch directly, dont wait one interval
x Fix send test punches interval for CHIP (seem to not use the selected interval)
x Make update work for CHIP also
x When getting alternative punch messages and guessing TH, take datarate/coderate into account.
x Detect SportIdent SRR usb stick, and open it in one-way mode
x Make GetReDCoSCombinationThreshold adjust to message datarate / coderate
x Add HAM frequencies, Probably should keep to fully within 433.7125 - 433,9625 to stay in the recommended Lora freqency bandx
x	HAM1 - 433,7375
x	HAM2 - 433,7875
x	HAM3 - 433,8375 
x	HAM4 - 433,8875
x	HAM5 - 433,9375
x add description to wiroc devices on the web
x Test air+
x show if all lora messages acked on webb and no of non acked messages (already sent)
x skicka vilka usb enheter (srr donglar) som är anslutna
x measure power consumption of  SRR receiver: arount 51 mA, 3.3V
    -- Sleep mode: maybe 50mA, very little difference if any
    -- Stop mode: 47mA so even then little difference...
x Send hwversion to webbserver, software versions

possible HW enhancments
-----------------------


Done

x Add RS232 conversion on board
x Add SRR receiver module/modules
x RTC (realtime clock)
x Reroute SDA, SCK to the display
x RS232 Serialport (use TTL->RS232 converter embedded in R232Connector)
x  -- Need to move GPIOA0-GPIO3 pins to GPIOC0-3 (GPIOA0 = TX, GPIOA1 = RX)
x Make the PCB the size and shape of the box
x Move the Rx and Tx LEDs together, use different colors. 
   -- Removed the status led and moved Rx and Tx apart instead
x Test resistor in series with button to see if we can get it not triggering under water
x     -- Gummiknappen ~50kohm
x     -- vitknapp ~30+kohm
x     -- svartknapp ~35kohm
x -> 51 kOhm fungerar (51+35kohm - 86 fungerar inte)
x -> 31 kOhm fungerar (31+35kohm - 66 fungerar inte)
x -> 26 kOhm fungerar (26+35kohm - 61 fungerar inte)
x ===> Seem to only be a problem when the antennaconnector is under water too, so shouldnt be an issue in real life. 
x      Even though, change the resistor  from 1K to 24Kohm


x BT address 6 bytes: REG 04-0FH: Data Cache
x hciconfig hci0 down
x sudo btmgmt public-addr B0:02:47:00:D7:6D
x hciconfig hci0 up
xIn startup script check AXP209 for bt address, then check settings.yaml and actual bt address.
x If AXP209 has address then use it and put it in settings
x If AXP209 is empty but settings.yaml has then write it to AXP209 and use it
x If both AXP209 and settings.yaml is empty then use the actual bt address and write it settings and axp209
 BUT if ForceBTAddress: true in settings.yaml then use that bt address and write it to AP209
