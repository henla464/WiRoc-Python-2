Change baudrate via serialport of BTadapter.
Connect RX to TX/TX to RX and use USB-serial
Command AT should give OK as response. (default baud is 9600 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, no hw)
AT+BAUD6 should change the baud rate to 38400, response should be 38400\r\n

sdptool is broken in Bluez 5

You need to run the blue tooth daemon in compatibility mode to provide deprecated command line interfaces. You're running Bluez5 and you need some Bluez4 functions. You can do this by editing this file

/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service
and changing this line

ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd
to this

ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --compat

and then restarting bluetooth like this

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
and you'll also have to change permissions on /var/run/sdp

sudo chmod 777 /var/run/sdp
