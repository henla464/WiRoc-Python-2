WiRoc
=====
Patch the BLE fails, add delay to the redo when fails
The status light shouldn't blink when BLE fails, fail the service also?

App
===
Make app work with old wiroc version


Done
----
X Add one-way option for connecting to samlingsboxar, srr dongles [WiRoc Python Done, app remaining]
X add RSSI to test punches
X Test RX Gain option (didn't see any difference in first test, but not sure if test was ok, RSSI is same. Dorji says enable can have small advantage)
x Add HW version file
x Add Settings file (for pesisting devicename, potentially other settings)

possible HW enhancments
-----------------------
RS232 Serialport (use TTL->RS232 converter embedded in R232Connector)
  -- Need to move GPIOA0-GPIO3 pins to GPIOC0-3 (GPIOA0 = TX, GPIOA1 = RX)
RTC (realtime clock)
Make the PCB the size and shape of the box
Move the Rx and Tx LEDs together, use different colors
Reroute SDA, SCK to the display
Test resistor in series with button to see if we can get it not triggering under water
    -- Gummiknappen ~50kohm
    -- vitknapp ~30+kohm
    -- svartknapp ~35kohm
-> 51 kOhm fungerar (51+35kohm - 86 fungerar inte)
-> 31 kOhm fungerar (31+35kohm - 66 fungerar inte)
-> 26 kOhm fungerar (26+35kohm - 61 fungerar inte)
===> Seem to only be a problem when the antennaconnector is under water too, so shouldnt be an issue in real life. Even though, change the resistor from 1K to 24Kohm



IDs
----
Options for IDs
Logical MessageID: cardno, time (and stationo) [4 bytes + 4 bytes] (all included in serialmessage)
Real MessageID: MemoryAddress 2 bytes, WiRoc-serialno 2 bytes

Ack could include request to resend missed messages. Good idea? Or just a resend adapter fetching from failed messages?
